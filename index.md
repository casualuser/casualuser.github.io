# Production-Grade Cloud & AI Infrastructure

Webomage is a small, senior engineering agency that fixes and builds production infrastructure, AI features, and platforms for SaaS and infra-heavy teams, led by **Aleksei Tcelishchev**.

We stabilise and modernise cloud-native systems on AWS and Kubernetes, plug AI/LLM into existing products, and ship production-grade MVPs and internal platforms.

### What we help with

- DevOps, SRE, and Kubernetes platforms on AWS (Terraform, GitOps, observability)
- Systems integration, data pipelines, and high-traffic backends that connect existing and new services
- AI/LLM-powered products, RAG pipelines, and internal copilots for operations and support
- Fullstack web and mobile backends that can start as MVPs and grow to production systems
- Compliance-aware design for regulated domains (HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI style requirements)
