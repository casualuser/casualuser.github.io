# Solutions

Webomage helps SaaS and infra-heavy teams in a few recurring ways. This page collects the main solution shapes and points you to the deeper pages and case studies.

## Platform & Reliability

- Design and operation of AWS- and Kubernetes-based platforms for SaaS products.
- Migrating from single servers or fragile clusters to managed EKS-style platforms.
- Consolidating serverless and event-driven systems into manageable architectures.

- [Serverless Consolidation for Event-Driven Workloads](/cases/serverless-consolidation/)

## AI & Product Acceleration

- Integrating AI/LLM features into existing products and internal tools.
- Building RAG pipelines, internal copilots, and evaluation/routing for multiple LLM providers.
- Hardening AI workloads on Kubernetes with zero-trust networking and better observability.

## Compliance, Recovery & Legacy

- Stabilising partly abandoned systems and bringing them back under safe, observable operations.
- Designing infra and data flows with HIPAA, SOC 2, and GDPR readiness in mind.
- Combining AI/LLM features with compliance-aware storage and processing.

### Compliance standards we work with

- **HIPAA-ready AI & data platforms** – designing data flows, storage, and access controls for US healthcare scenarios, with PHI protection, auditability, and clear separation between clinical and non-clinical workloads.
- **GDPR-aware data architecture** – handling data residency, data minimisation, and deletion/export flows for EU/EEA users, with clear boundaries between processors and controllers in your architecture.
- **SOC 2-aligned infra & logging** – structuring infrastructure, logging, and change management so they map cleanly onto SOC 2 controls (security, availability, confidentiality) and are easier to evidence during audits.
- **ISO 27001-oriented cloud security** – aligning cloud infrastructure, secrets management, and backup/DR patterns with ISO 27001-style information security management practices.
