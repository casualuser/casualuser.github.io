so this is concept of logo

styled letters W, O and M

O is the central circle
W looks like arc outside O following O shape
central hill of W is in the center of left half of O and second line up to the central hill is also an arc(half-circle) with full diameter height
third line is a part of golden spiral
and the last line is vertical straight line

the M letter is mirroring W, but with the same proportions and spacing
all lines should have consistent stroke width and color (e.g., blue or teal)
the overall design should be clean, modern, and scalable for both web and print

element metaphors:
- W = water (outer left arcs and curves read as waves / flow)
- O = earth / planet (central circle, stable core)
- M = air (right-side arcs and curves, lighter/upward motion)

color palette (CSS keywords):
- W stroke: DodgerBlue (#1e90ff)
- O stroke: ForestGreen (#228b22)
- M stroke: DarkOrange (#ff8c00)

golden-ratio and spiral guides:
- base circle O: center (840, 300), radius R = 240
- guides in logo_check.svg show:
  - axes through O center and vertical lines at x = 840 ± R/φ (≈ 691.7, 988.3)
  - additional harmonic lines for fine-tuning W/M stroke positions
  - two phi-spiral guide curves approximating quarter-turn golden spirals into/out of the circle
- production logo paths follow these guides visually using cubic Bézier curves (not exact analytic spirals).
