**Who it’s for**  
Teams building wallets, dApps or analytics products that depend on blockchain data.

- Missing monitoring and alerting for node health and chain data
- Fragile indexing or event-processing backends around the chain

**What we deliver**

- Robust node or validator infrastructure (where appropriate)
- Monitoring, logs and alerts for node health and important metrics
- Backend services (indexers / APIs) for your application use cases
- Deployment pipelines for both infra and application code

**Outcome**  
A dependable Web3 backend you can build features on, with clear visibility and controlled operational risk.
