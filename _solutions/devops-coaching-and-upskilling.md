**Who it’s for**  
Teams that have strong developers but limited DevOps/SRE experience.

**Problems we solve**

- Knowledge gaps around CI/CD, infrastructure as code and observability
- Reliance on a single "DevOps person" for everything
- Lack of shared practices and standards across teams

**What we deliver**

- Assessment of current workflows, tooling and gaps
- Pragmatic standards for CI/CD, environments and monitoring
- Pairing sessions and workshops tailored to your stack
- Example pipelines and infrastructure patterns the team can copy

**Outcome**  
Your engineers become more confident and autonomous in operating and evolving the platform, reducing single points of failure.
