**Who it’s for**  
Engineering and support teams that want practical AI help on top of existing tools.

**Problems we solve**

- Slow incident triage and context-gathering across logs, dashboards and docs
- Repetitive support questions that could be safely automated or assisted
- Concern about "black box" AI behavior in critical workflows

**What we deliver**

- Design of realistic AI use cases for your stack (no hype, just value)
- Prototypes of incident summaries, runbook suggestions or support replies
- Integrations with your existing tools (docs, ticketing, observability)
- Guardrails, metrics and cost controls for AI usage

**Outcome**  
Your team gets faster at understanding and resolving issues, with AI as an assistant—not a replacement or unmanaged risk.
