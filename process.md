Webomage is a small, senior engineering agency. We run projects in a lightweight but disciplined way so you always know what happens next.

## 1. Intro & Fit

- Short call or async exchange to understand your product, constraints, and why now.  
- Clarify tech stack, timelines, and who will be involved from your side.  
- Decide if there is a good mutual fit; if not, we’ll say so quickly.

## 2. Discovery & Audit

- Deep dive into your current systems: code, infra, diagrams, logs, existing docs.  
- Identify risks, quick wins, and areas that need stabilisation or redesign.  
- For compliance‑sensitive work (HIPAA/SOC 2 style), map data flows and access patterns.

## 3. Plan & Proposal

- Concise technical plan with clear phases, risks, and assumptions.  
- Focused on outcomes: e.g. "jumphost + DNS for secure access", "AI MVP → production‑ready pipeline", "legacy CRM stabilised and documented".  
- Scope can start small (audit, POC, or first slice) with options for follow‑on phases.

## 4. Build, Integrate, Iterate

- Execute in short, well‑defined iterations with visible progress (commits, small PRs, changelogs).  
- Prefer automation, observability, and tests as we go rather than as an afterthought.  
- Regular check‑ins (async-friendly) with you and your team to adjust priorities.

## 5. Handover & Next Steps

- Document what was built: architecture diagrams, runbooks, and "first steps" for your team.  
- Knowledge transfer sessions for engineers and operators where needed.  
- Options for follow‑up work: continued improvements, new features, or periodic audits.
