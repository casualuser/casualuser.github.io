## Description

The LAMP stack is a classic, battle-tested architecture for hosting dynamic websites and content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, or custom PHP applications.

It relies on Linux as the OS, Apache as the web server, MySQL (or MariaDB) for relational data, and PHP as the scripting language.
