# Blockchain & Web3

I build and maintain blockchain and web3 backends, from infrastructure to smart contract integrations and DApp support.

## Focus Areas

- Ethereum-based applications using web3.py and related tooling
- Wallet creation, transaction signing, and secure key management
- Smart contract integrations, ICO/sidechain scenarios, and DeFi protocols
- Indexing and analytics with The Graph (subgraphs) and related services
- Running and maintaining blockchain nodes and supporting infrastructure

## Example Work

- **Ripple/Stellar and Hyperledger Sawtooth**  
  Participated in crafting and deploying Ripple/Stellar verification nodes and Intel/IBM Hyperledger Sawtooth–based universal blockchain systems.

- **DeFi platforms (TokensFarm, DcentraLab, 2key Network)**  
  Developed DeFi backends with Python (web3.py, eth-abi), integrating with Ethereum nodes and smart contracts. Implemented subgraphs, DApp APIs, and CI/CD for blockchain workloads.

- **Web3 integrations & infrastructure hardening**  
  Solved complex web3 issues around nonce handling, gas spikes, and provider behavior. Migrated shared IPFS to dedicated storage, hosted The Graph instances, and hardened RPC nodes.

## Typical Deliverables

- Backend services and APIs for DApps and DeFi platforms
- Infrastructure on AWS/Kubernetes tailored for blockchain workloads
- Monitoring and alerting around node health, transaction flows, and contracts
- Secure integrations with third-party APIs (Coingecko, 1inch, DexGuru, DefiLlama, etc.)
