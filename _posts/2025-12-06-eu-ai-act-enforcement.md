As of this week, the **EU AI Act** has entered its first major enforcement phase for high-risk AI systems. Companies operating in the EU must now demonstrate transparency in their data training practices and provide clear documentation for large-Scale models.

### Immediate Impact
Creating a "compliance-first" architecture is no longer optional. We are already seeing the first fines levied against organizations for non-compliant data handling. This shifts the role of the AI Engineer towards data governance, requiring strict lineage tracking from dataset to deployed model.

### Action Item
Review your model cards and data sheets. Ensure that every model in production has a traceable audit trail backing its training data. The "move fast and break things" era of AI data is officially over in Europe.
