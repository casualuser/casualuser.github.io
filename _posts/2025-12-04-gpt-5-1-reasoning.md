Just days after rumors circulated, OpenAI has deployed **GPT-5.1**, a model that doubles down on conversational reasoning. Unlike its predecessors, 5.1 is designed to "think" more primarily before responding, reducing hallucination rates in complex logic tasks.

### The "Atlas" Browser
Accompanying the model is **ChatGPT Atlas**, a new browser that integrates AI deeply into the web navigation experience. This isn't just a sidebar copilot; Atlas actively parses and reformats web content for better consumption, challenging the traditional search-and-click paradigm.

### Strategic Shift
For developers, the 5.1 API offers new "reasoning tokens" that allow for inspection of the model's logic chain. This is crucial for building trustworthy agentic workflows where "show your work" is a requirement, not a feature.
