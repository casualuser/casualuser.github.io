The headline from **AWS re:Invent 2025** is clear: the era of the autonomous agent has arrived. Amazon announced a suite of new services designed to help developers build agents that can plan tasks, write code, and operate infrastructure with minimal human oversight.

### The DevOps Agent
Of particular interest to our community is the new **AWS DevOps Agent**. This specialized agent analyzes data across CloudWatch, X-Ray, and CodePipeline to identify root causes of incidents and even coordinate automated responses. It promises to reduce mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) by acting as an always-on site reliability engineer.

### Workspace Studio with Gemini
Interestingly, Google also made waves this week with **Workspace Studio**, leveraging their Gemini 3 model to manage AI agents. But AWS's focus on infrastructure-centric agents positions them uniquely for the backend and platform engineering space.
