The **Global AI Show** in Abu Dhabi wrapped up this weekend, highlighting the massive capital flowing into AI infrastructure from the Middle East. Sovereign wealth funds are pivoting aggressively from oil to compute, funding some of the largest data center projects in the world.

### Compute Sovereignty
A recurring theme was "compute sovereignty"—the idea that nations need their own independent AI infrastructure to remain competitive and secure. This is driving demand for localized LPU (Language Processing Unit) clusters that operate independently of US or Chinese cloud giants.

### Market Shift
For global engineering firms, this opens up new markets for on-premise AI deployment expertise. The demand isn't just for software, but for the full stack of power, cooling, and hardware orchestration needed to run sovereign AI.
