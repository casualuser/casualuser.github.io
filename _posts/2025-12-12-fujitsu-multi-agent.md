Fujitsu has unveiled a new protocol for **secure multi-AI agent collaboration**. As businesses deploy agents from different vendors (e.g., a Salesforce sales agent talking to an SAP inventory agent), security boundaries have become blurry.

### Trust Layers
The new technology establishes a "trust layer" that verifies the identity and intent of an external agent before allowing it to access internal data. It essentially functions as an API gateway for autonomous agents.

### The Future of B2B AI
This infrastructure is a prerequisite for the "Agent Economy." Without it, automated cross-company collaboration is too risky. We expect standards bodies to adopt similar protocols rapidly as agent-to-agent traffic grows in 2026.
