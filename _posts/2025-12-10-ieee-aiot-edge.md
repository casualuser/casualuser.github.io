Coverage from **IEEE AIoT 2025** confirms that Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has moved beyond the proof-of-concept phase. The focus has shifted from "can we run AI on the edge?" to "how do we orchestrate it effectively?".

### Federated Learning
A key theme of the conference was the maturation of federated learning protocols. Devices can now collaboratively update global models without sharing raw user data, solving a major privacy bottleneck for healthcare and smart home applications.

### Infrastructure Challenge
The challenge now lies in the "EdgeOps" layer—managing the lifecycle of models across thousands of heterogeneous devices. This is where Kubernetes distribution for edge (like K3s and KubeEdge) will play a critical role in the coming year.
