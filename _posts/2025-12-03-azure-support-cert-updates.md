Microsoft is retiring several niche Azure and support engineer certifications effective July 31, 2023, including Azure Stack Hub Operator, Azure IoT Developer, Azure Support Engineer for Connectivity, Exchange Online Support Engineer, and Teams Support Engineer. This move aligns training with real-world responsibilities by emphasizing broader, role-based certifications that better support hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

Engineering leaders should guide teams toward recommended alternatives: Azure Administrator Associate and Windows Server Hybrid Administrator Associate for hybrid operations; Azure Network Engineer Associate and Azure Administrator Associate for networking and connectivity; and Messaging Administrator Associate or the new Collaboration Communications Systems Engineer for messaging and collaboration support. Existing certification holders retain their credentials on transcripts and have a final renewal window.

For DevOps and infrastructure teams, this shift reduces fragmentation in skill validation, enabling focus on comprehensive competencies essential for managing Azure workloads at scale. Webomage recommends reviewing Microsoft Learn paths and practice assessments to map current skills to these updated certifications, ensuring alignment with evolving infra demands.
