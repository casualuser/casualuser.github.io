The Kubernetes community has announced the release of **Kubernetes 1.35**, a security-focused update that introduces 17 major enhancements aimed at fortifying container environments. 

### Security First
The standout features in v1.35 include improved pod isolation mechanisms and stricter default access controls. The update also streamlines certificate management, a long-time pain point for cluster administrators. By deprecating several outdated components, the Kubernetes team has effectively reduced the attack surface for standard deployments.

### AI Workload Readiness
Alongside security, v1.35 introduces new "Gang Scheduling" and "Node-declared features" in alpha, specifically designed to better handle distributed AI training workloads. This signals Kubernetes' continued evolution into the de-facto operating system for AI infrastructure.
