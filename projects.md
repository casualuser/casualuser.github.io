# Projects & Case Studies

A selection of Webomage engagements across DevOps, cloud infrastructure, blockchain, and AI/ML integrations, with enough detail to see how we actually work.

## AI & Automation

- **YC-backed AI Startup (Hong Kong)** — AI infrastructure & tooling for a fast-moving LLM product team.  
  Integrated multiple AI tools and LLM services (including LangChain and OpenAI-like APIs) into production infrastructure, with scalable deployments, advanced debugging, and contributions back to open source.  
  See the dedicated case study: [YC-backed AI Startup – AI Infrastructure & Tooling](/cases/yc-ai-startup/).

- **Long-form psychiatric session voice analytics** — turning 1.5h+ clinical audio into structured, compliance-aware insights.  
  Refactored a Next.js + Google STT + Vertex AI MVP into a production-ready pipeline processing 1.5h+ psychiatric voice sessions with compliance-aware storage and analysis.  
  See the dedicated case study: [Long-Form Psychiatric Session Voice Analytics](/cases/psychiatric-voice-ai/).

- **US Law Firms Association – CRM Automation & Recovery** — rescuing an abandoned CRM and rebuilding AI-driven client outreach.  
  Built large-scale CRM automation integrating AI-based calls and emotional context detection in human responses, enabling more adaptive client interactions.  
  See also the dedicated case study: [Law Firms Association CRM Recovery](/cases/law-firms-crm/).

- **Healthcare AI Services**  
  Designed and deployed AI-powered healthcare services with strong emphasis on HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI, and GDPR readiness, auditable data flows, and reliable pipelines.

- **Zero-Trust AI Platform on Kubernetes** — locking down AI workloads on Kubernetes with zero-trust networking and better observability.  
  Defined and implemented a zero-trust blueprint around LLM gateways, feature stores, and data pipelines, tightening traffic paths and improving monitoring without slowing delivery.  
  See the dedicated case study: [Zero-Trust AI Platform on Kubernetes](/cases/zero-trust-ai-platform/).

## Blockchain & Web3

- **Ripple/Stellar & Hyperledger Sawtooth** — core infra work on enterprise and payment-focused chains.  
  Participated in crafting and deployment of Ripple/Stellar verification nodes and Intel/IBM Hyperledger Sawtooth-based blockchain systems.

- **Ethereum & DApps** — smart contracts, wallets, ICO/sidechain scenarios, and on-chain data indexing.  
  Worked with Ethereum nodes, smart contracts, ICO/sidechain scenarios, wallet and transaction management, and The Graph for advanced data querying.

- **DeFi infrastructure hardening & observability** — making DeFi infra observable and resilient instead of “best effort”.  
  Hardened DeFi infrastructure and indexing around protocols running on Ethereum and sidechains, reducing infra-related incidents and improving monitoring.  
  See the dedicated case study: [DeFi Infrastructure Hardening & Observability](/cases/defi-infra-hardening/).

## Cloud & DevOps

- **AWS Infrastructure & Serverless** — modernising estates into Terraform-managed, event-driven AWS platforms.  
  Designed secure, scalable AWS architectures with Terraform, Lambda, API Gateway, Auto Scaling, and CI/CD. Implemented asynchronous Lambda flows and complex deployment strategies.  
  See the dedicated case study: [Serverless Consolidation for Event-Driven Workloads](/cases/serverless-consolidation/).

- **Kubernetes & Containerization** — moving from pets and scripts to reliable, GitOps-driven clusters.  
  Architected Kubernetes clusters (including EKS and self-hosted) with advanced networking, monitoring, and deployment patterns using Docker and GitOps.  
  See the dedicated case study: [Kubernetes Platform Migration for SaaS](/cases/k8s-platform-migration/).
