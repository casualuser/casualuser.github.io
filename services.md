## DevOps & Infrastructure

- Migration from a single big VPS with `docker-compose` to scalable, managed AWS EKS clusters with Karpenter.
- Refactoring legacy Django/DRF applications to be stateless and cloud-native.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk to Kubernetes migrations (e.g. Django / Angular.js workloads to GKE).
- 50+ AWS Lambda functions moved from custom scripts to the Serverless Framework for repeatable, automated deployments.

## Integrations & Platform Work

- Event-driven and microservice-style integrations between existing systems and new services.
- API design and implementation for internal and external integrations.
- Platform hardening, observability, and automation around CI/CD.

## AI / LLM Solutions

- Next.js + Google Speech-to-Text + Vertex AI MVPs refactored into production-ready solutions with tRPC ultra-fast backends.
- Handling long-running artefacts from 1.5h+ voice psychiatric sessions with storage and processing aligned with HIPAA and SOC 2 considerations.

## Fullstack & Mobile

- Next.js / React frontends integrated with modern backends and existing APIs.
- Delivery of MVPs for startups, tailored to specific business needs and constraints.
- Collaboration with mobile app teams where backend and infra need to support native or cross-platform clients.

## Compliance & Reliability

- Security and compliance-aware infrastructure and pipeline design.
- Observability, logging, and monitoring built in from day one.

## Engineering Practices (Non‑Negotiables)

- Well-written technical specs that include non-technical, DSL-style feature descriptions from the Project Manager, plus final DSL end-to-end tests with metrics.
- Automation everywhere, with easy control and observability.
- A strict "single source of truth" rule for all docs/specs, with cross-fact checking between docs, specs, code, tests, and infrastructure.

## Recent Similar Project

- Security audit and recovery of a partly abandoned CRM for a Law Firms Association, including AI services and mobile apps, after the original dev team and team lead were lost.
