## Services & Technical Focus

- Next.js + Google Speech-to-Text + Vertex AI MVP refactored into a production-ready solution with tRPC ultra-fast backend. All artefacts from 1.5h+ voice psychiatric sessions stored and processed with HIPAA and SOC 2 considerations.
- Migration from single big VPS with `docker-compose` to a scalable, managed AWS EKS cluster with Karpenter. Legacy Django/DRF application refactored to be stateless.
- 50+ AWS Lambda functions moved from custom scripts to the Serverless Framework for repeatable, automated deployments.
- Migration of a Django / Angular.js application from AWS Elastic Beanstalk to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
- Architecture and delivery of multiple MVPs for startups, tailored to specific business needs and constraints.

## Engineering Practices (Non‑Negotiables)

- Well-written technical specs that include non-technical, DSL-style feature descriptions from the Project Manager, plus final DSL end-to-end tests with metrics.
- Automation everywhere, with easy control and observability.
- A strict "single source of truth" rule for all docs/specs, with cross-fact checking between docs, specs, code, tests, and infrastructure.

## Recent Similar Project

- Security audit and recovery of a partly abandoned CRM for a Law Firms Association, including AI services and mobile apps, after the original dev team and team lead were lost.
