# YC-backed AI Startup – AI Infrastructure & Tooling

A YC-backed AI startup in Hong Kong needed to turn a fast-moving set of AI ideas and experiments into reliable, observable production infrastructure. Webomage helped connect multiple AI tools and LLM providers into a cohesive, debuggable platform the team could safely evolve.

## Context & Challenges

- Multiple AI services and LLM providers in play, each with different APIs and operational characteristics.
- Rapid iteration on features, but limited time to keep infrastructure, observability, and deployment practices in sync.
- Need for advanced debugging and experimentation without breaking production traffic.
- Early-stage team requiring patterns they could own going forward, not a black-box setup.

## What We Did

- Designed and implemented a production-ready AI infrastructure around existing tools and code.
- Integrated several LLM providers and AI tools behind clear interfaces for easier routing and experimentation.
- Introduced orchestration patterns (e.g. LangChain-style flows) that made it easier to plug in new tools and prompts.
- Set up CI/CD and environment separation, so experiments could be rolled out gradually and safely.
- Improved logging and tracing around AI calls to make debugging and performance tuning much faster.

## Outcomes

- A more stable, observable AI platform that could support both experiments and production traffic.
- Faster iteration cycles, with the ability to test and compare different tools and providers.
- Reduced operational risk by standardising deployment and rollback patterns.
- Clear documentation and handover so the startup’s own team could extend the system.

## Relevant Capabilities

- Multi-provider LLM integrations and routing.
- AI/LLM orchestration and evaluation patterns.
- CI/CD, environments, and gradual rollout strategies for AI services.
- Observability and debugging for AI-heavy systems.
