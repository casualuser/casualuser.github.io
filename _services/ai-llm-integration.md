I help teams design and implement AI/LLM-powered features that are reliable, observable and cost-aware.

**Possible use cases:**

- Developer and DevOps copilots tailored to your stack
- Intelligent search over internal documentation and logs
- Smart alerts and incident summaries

**Outcome:** concrete, maintainable AI capabilities added to your platform, with monitoring and cost controls from day one.
