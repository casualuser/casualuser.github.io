summary: "Move from ad-hoc servers to a solid, code-defined cloud foundation."

I help teams move from manually managed servers to a clean, reproducible cloud setup.

**You get:**

- Baseline cloud account review (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- Core networking, IAM and environment structure
- Infrastructure as Code baseline (Terraform)
- Simple CI/CD skeleton for 1–2 services

**Outcome:** you can recreate your infrastructure from code instead of the console, and you know what to improve next.
