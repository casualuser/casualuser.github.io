title: "Infrastructure Audit & Roadmap"
summary: "A deeper assessment of your cloud, security and reliability with a 30–90 day plan."

A short engagement (typically 3–5 days) to audit your infrastructure and produce a practical roadmap.

**We review:**

- Cloud accounts, environments and access patterns
- Networking, security groups and secrets management
- CI/CD pipelines and deployment practices
- Monitoring, logging and incident handling

**Outcome:** a written report with risks, quick wins and a prioritized roadmap for the next 30–90 days.
