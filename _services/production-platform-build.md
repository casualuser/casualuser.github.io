title: "Production-Ready Platform Build"
summary: "Prepare your product for real traffic with a hardened, observable platform."

For teams getting ready to launch or scale beyond MVP, I design and build a production-ready platform.

**You get:**

- High-availability architecture design
- Container or Kubernetes-based deployment (if appropriate)
- Secure secrets and configuration strategy
- Observability stack (metrics, logs, alerts)
- Safer deployment workflows (blue/green or canary)

**Outcome:** a platform you can safely deploy to every day, with visibility into how it behaves in production.
