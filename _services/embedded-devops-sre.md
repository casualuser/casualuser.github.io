title: "Embedded DevOps / SRE Partner"
summary: "Ongoing senior DevOps/SRE support without hiring a full-time employee."
---

I act as an embedded DevOps/SRE for your team on a part-time, long-term basis.

**You get:**

- Reserved hours each month for infrastructure, CI/CD and reliability work
- Help with incidents and root-cause analysis
- Continuous improvements to pipelines, monitoring and security
- Regular check-ins with a clear backlog and roadmap

**Outcome:** you gain a senior DevOps/SRE partner who steadily improves your platform while your team focuses on product.
