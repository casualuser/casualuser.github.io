so this is concept of logo

styled letters W, O and M

O is the central circle
W looks like arc outside O following O shape
central hill of W is in the center of left half of O and second line up to the central hill is also an arc(half-circle) with full diameter height
third line is a part of golden spiral
and the last line is vertical straight line

the M letter is mirroring W, but with the same proportions and spacing
all lines should have consistent stroke width and color (e.g., blue or teal)
the overall design should be clean, modern, and scalable for both web and print
